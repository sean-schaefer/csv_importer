## Next Steps

Potential new features to add:

* Sexy UI!
* Handling alternate CSV delimiters, quoting etc.
* Allowing client to specify the sorting field + ascending vs. descending
* Identifying duplicate records (name + artist combination)
* Updating middleware to not crash and burn when client POSTs with no file
